This file contains the list of various toolbox functions that are not 
included in the CTF file. An error will be thrown if any of these functions
 are called at run-time. Some of these functions may be from toolboxes 
that you are not using in your application. The reason for this is that 
these toolboxes have overloaded some methods that are called by your code. 
If you know which toolboxes are being used by your code, you can use the -p
 flag with the -N flag to list these toolboxes explicitly. This will 
cause MATLAB Compiler to only look for functions in the specified toolbox 
directories in addition to the MATLAB directories. Refer to the MCC 
documentation for more information on this.

0 item(s) removed. You can review the mccExcludedFiles.log file for the list of functions not included in the CTF archive.
